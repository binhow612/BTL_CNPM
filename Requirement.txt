Domain Context:
Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology - Student Smart Printing Service (HCMUT-SSPS) mostly revolves around the educational domain, specifically serving the printing needs of students in HCMUT, by providing a convenient and efficient printing service for students across the university’s campuses. The service operates by placing multiple printers in school campuses and allowing students to interact with them using a software. In the software, students can be authenticated using HCMUT_SSO service for better security and user identity. Students can print up to a certain limit with custom configurations and pay for more credits through online banking systems like BKPay or view their printing history. The limit of pages, page reset date and file types can be configured by the Student Printing Service Officer (SPSO). In addition, the SPSO can also view the students’ printing log or the log of some or all printers as well as changing the availability of printers. The service also provides reports and analytics about the printing usage monthly and annually, which can be viewed by the SPSO. In conclusion, the system aims not only to provide the students in HCMUT a efficient and reliable printing service but also helps the university to acquire students’ satisfaction about its education quality
